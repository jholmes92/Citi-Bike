Welcome to the Citi Bike Distribution Analysis Dashboard. As the lead analyst for a bike-sharing service based in New York City, our objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data from Citi Bike facilities. Our goal is to uncover actionable insights to address distribution issues, ensuring a seamless experience for our users and further solidifying our position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city.

Context: Citi Bike has experienced increased popularity, particularly since the Covidâ€“19 pandemic, leading to higher demand and distribution challenges. This dashboard serves as a tool to diagnose distribution issues and provide informed recommendations to enhance our logistics model.

Let's explore the data and discover insights to optimize our bike distribution strategy.

    - The colors of the chart are at their darkest as we get to the highest reporting trip stations. For example, West 21st Street and 6th Avenue lead with well over 3000 trips. Therefore, this route is a deep, dark red. On the far right, you can see 9th Avenue and West 22nd Street is a faint white with a hint of red. This indicates it is one of the lowest on the graph, reporting just over 2000 trips.
    - Over 75% of the options displayed in this graph reported somewhere between 2000 and 2500 trips. Our top 25% report exceptional numbers, but do not represent the type of trip numbers we see most of these locations producing.

This interactive chart illustrates the daily trends of bike rides and temperature in New York City. Understanding the relationship between these two factors is essential for analyzing user behavior and identifying potential correlations with distribution challenges.

Bike rides: Represents the daily count of bike rides, reflecting user demand and usage patterns.
Temperature: Indicates the daily average temperature, which may influence user preferences and biking activity.

By examining these trends together, we can gain insights into how weather conditions impact bike usage and distribution patterns, aiding in the formulation of informed strategies for addressing availability issues and optimizing bike distribution across the city.

- To be completely transparent with everyone, I find this chart extremely confusing to interpret with just a quick glance. A bar chart may have been a smarter approach, and we will consider that next time.
- That said, there is a clear arch we can see the chart take as we move left to right. Looking at the timeline, the count, and temperatures, we can see that our trips grow substantially over the spring & summer months. This analysis is consistent with what we already knew but could be used to understand just how much greater it is than in the fall and winter.

- There are 3 main takeaways from these images. First, in the 'Trips' image, we can see clearly where our top 10 or so most popular routes are located. This allows us to understand why that might be as additional geographical analysis can be made around those addresses
-  Secondly, the 'Starting Point' image gives us a clear idea of where we not only are covering in NYC but where it becomes brighter and more dense. This means certain areas have more riders, which means the need for more units, more opportunity, and ultimately, more sales.
- Lastly, I'd like to direct your attention to the 'Start to End | Arc' image. We can see that in the center of the city, there is a large swath of rides that leave the downtown core and move outward. We can learn from this, and use similar visualizations on the map to determine our locations that require the greatest need, and as I mentioned in the last point, the most sales.
